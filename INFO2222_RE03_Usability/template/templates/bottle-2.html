    <h1>Tutorial: Todo-List Application</h1>
    <p class="mute"><i>This article is credit to <a
        href="https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial_app.html">Bottle Official</a></i></p>

    <p>This tutorial should give a brief introduction to the Bottle WSGI Framework. The main goal is to be able, after
      reading through this tutorial, to create a project using Bottle. Within this document, not all abilities will be
      shown, but at least the main and important ones like routing, utilizing the Bottle template abilities to format
      output and handling GET / POST parameters.


    </p>
    <p>To understand the content here, it is not necessary to have a basic knowledge of WSGI, as Bottle tries to keep
      WSGI away from the user anyway. You should have a fair understanding of the Python programming language.
      Furthermore, the example used in the tutorial retrieves and stores data in a SQL database, so a basic idea about
      SQL helps, but is not a must to understand the concepts of Bottle. Right here, SQLite is used. The output of
      Bottle sent to the browser is formatted in some examples by the help of HTML. Thus, a basic idea about the common
      HTML tags does help as well.</p>
    <p>For the sake of introducing Bottle, the Python code “in between” is kept short, in order to keep the focus. Also
      all code within the tutorial is working fine, but you may not necessarily use it “in the wild”, e.g. on a public
      web server. In order to do so, you may add e.g. more error handling, protect the database with a password, test
      and escape the input etc.</p>

    <p>At the end of this tutorial, we will have a simple, web-based ToDo list. The list contains a text (with max 100
      characters) and a status (0 for closed, 1 for open) for each item. Through the web-based user interface, open
      items can be view and edited and new items can be added.</p>
    <p>During development, all pages will be available on localhost only, but later on it will be shown how to adapt the
      application for a “real” server, including how to use with Apache’s mod_wsgi.</p>
    <p>Bottle will do the routing and format the output, with the help of templates. The items of the list will be
      stored inside a SQLite database. Reading and writing the database will be done by Python code.</p>
    <p>
      We will end up with an application with the following pages and functionality:</p>
    <ul class="simple">
      <li>start page <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://localhost:8080/todo</span></code></li>
      <li>adding new items to the list: <code class="docutils literal"><span
          class="pre">http://localhost:8080/new</span></code></li>
      <li>page for editing items: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://localhost:8080/edit/&lt;no:int&gt;</span></code>
      </li>
      <li>catching errors</li>
    </ul>
